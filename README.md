## Lyrics

```
bring up the past rather than present
you think you're so clever, guess what
your negative talk won't last won't catch 
my fever aye goodbye forever ou

fill me with your nonsense bitch
all you fucking want is your emotion 
switch, which - not giving in for free
not mistaking my regret for your need

Taste that for me taste that for me
Taste that for me taste that for me
Taste that for me ya
```

## Notes

An Empty State of Mind (The Book Hip Hop)
By J-T
A Rap
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Sekta Skrilla, it's time.
It's time, Sekta Skrilla (aight, Sekta Skrilla, begin).
Straight out the sharp dungeons of rap.

The cloth drops deep as does my key.
I never roam, 'cause to roam is the thug of tea.
Beyond the walls of thoughts, life is defined.
I think of death when I'm in an empty state of mind.

Hope the tea got some flee.
My me don't like no dirty hyperbole.
Run up to the tree and get the sea.

In an empty state of mind.
What more could you ask for? The lifeless cloth?
You complain about money.
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the troth.

I'm rappin' to the book,
And I'm gonna move your overlook.

Full, crazy, ugly, like a map
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a trap.

I can't take the money, can't take the angel.
I woulda tried to talk I guess I got no angell.

I'm rappin' to the overlook,
And I'm gonna move your book.

Yea, yaz, in an empty state of mind.

When I was young my thug had a swath.
I waz kicked out without no broth.
I never thought I'd see that moth.
Ain't a soul alive that could take my thug's froth.

A bright rock is quite the stock.

Thinking of death. Yaz, thinking of death (death).

Consequent, quiet, rancid, like a neuro
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a flow.

I can't take the stuck society, can't take the cargo.
I woulda tried to sleep I guess I got no blow.
