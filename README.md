## Lyrics

```
bring up the past rather than present
you think you're so clever, guess what
your negative talk won't last won't catch 
my fever aye goodbye forever ou

fill me with your nonsense bitch
all you fucking want is your emotion 
switch, which - not giving in for free
not mistaking my regret for your need

Taste that for me taste that for me
Taste that for me taste that for me
Taste that for me ya
```
